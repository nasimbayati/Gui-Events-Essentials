# Gui_Events_Essentials

Two tiny Java GUI apps showing basic mouse events and repainting.

## Commands
- `swing [name]` — Click in a `JPanel` to show x,y (black), clearing old text.
- `awt [name]` — Move = x,y in black; Drag = x,y in red (basic AWT `Frame`).

## Build
```bat
build.bat
```
## Run

```bat
java -cp bin src.App swing "Your Name"
java -cp bin src.App awt "Your Name"
```

## Notes
* Window close exits the app.

* Pure Swing/AWT, beginner-friendly.
